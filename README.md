TastingNotes Version 3
======================

This is the original version of Tasting Notes that was updated to iOS 6 a while back.  Right now I'm updating this app to iOS 7 while removing features that are no longer needed as much (Google Analytics and Dropbox).  The UI is being simplied to match iOS 7 expectations and also to anticipate the likely move to iOS 8 in the summer and fall.

This version of Tasting Notes uses a SQLite database to support the customizable notebook model.  I have also created a Core Data version of this service in another project.  In the future, I may switch this model but I haven't yet decided if that is a good idea considering the amount of integration the current model has.
